The more specific you are, the more likely you’ll find anomalies with few false positives.  When results are found, the question to think on is, for example, “Is that the normal location for that file on the specific OS version?”  Are files usually packed?  If so, what is the packer most commonly used?  With Yara, you can filter for specific versions of a packer as small changes are made as the program is updated.  Also, packing files is not that unusual.  Is it unusual for the specific OS and the file found?\n",
